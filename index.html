	  <h2>Who are we?</h2>
	  	<div class="sectionText">
	  		<p>Women are distinct from men in various aspects. The greatest distinction is that female beings are given the ability to procreate life. Unfortunately with this ability, women are limited by a monthly expulsion of the inner lining, menstration. Some women are able manage their periods well; however, most are unable keep track of it due to the irregular timing of their cycle.</p>
	  	</div>
	  		
	  	<div class="sectionText">
	  		<p>Many young teenage girls struggle in managing this monthly occurrence. In fact, NU has found that many young working professionals and students also have this need of being able to track their periods as well. In recent years, NU has discovered a hormone variant, LH that allows us to have the ability to predict how far along the user it along the current cycle.</p>
	  	</div>

	  	<div class="sectionText"> 
	  		<p>As this monthly occurrence brings much inconvenience to women's life, NU has created a new upcoming product to the feminine hygiene market. Without being invasive to the human body or drastic changes to daily life, NULiner are able to provide real-time support and to detect bodily signals from the individual's body in order to calculate the monthly cycle's timing.</p>

		 		<h3>Why should you use <span>NUliner</span> ?</h3>
		 		<br>
				<p>NUliner presents an effective and advantageous solution for many young and adult women.</p>

				<p>For many women who suffer from an irregular menstrual cycle, it is problematic and strenuous to keep track of their own cycles through a calendar.</p>

				<p>Through the usage of NUliner, this product will alleviate the stress of managing time around a female’s monthly cycle.</p>
			</div>
		 	<div id=popupOne class="hidden">
		 		<h3>Fact # 1</h3>
		 		<p>Although NULiner is not reusable like other leading brands, it is able to keep you comfortable without having to worry about any odours during the day. You can continue to go about your usual day without any hassle.</p>
		 		<br>
		 		<p>In order to stay comfortable and confident for the day, NULiner has a built-in anti-bacterial deodorizer that works to neutralize lingering odours and leaves a pleasant scent after doing its job.</p>
		 	</div>
			<div id=popupTwo class="hidden">
				<h3>Fact # 2</h3>
			 	<p>NULiners are disposable; however due to our newest absorption technology, the breathable material on a NULiner can last for a longer period of time and help you stay dry for up to 8 hours of usage.</p>
			 	<br>
			 	<p>Due to the newly patented material used, it allows for the liner to be used up to the recommended 6-8 hours. Instead of changing every 2-3 hours, it alleviates the overall costs for feminine hygiene products in the long run.</p>
			</div>
			<div id=popupThree class="hidden">
				<h3>Fact # 3</h3>
			 	<p>Acting as absorption material and a tester, the liner will react with the individual’s discharge and alter the colour of the material in order to indicate where Sarah is in her cycle. The LH hormone is more evident as the bodily fluids are more acidic and thus the material will react by producing a dark, deep orange colour.</p>

	  <h2>What is the "Luteinizing Hormone"?</h2>
	  <div class="overall">
	  	<div class="SectionTwo">
	  		<p>NUliner seeks to provide better and improved daily living for females. NU has found a hormone variant in our bodies called the Luteinizing Hormone (LH). This hormone detects different signs and signals of the monthly menstrual cycle.</p>

	  		<p>Though the average number of days of the menstrual cycle is 28 days, it differs from each individual’s body. Women’s cycles vary due to many factors such as medication, varying hormone levels and even a person’s stress or emotional state.</p>

	  		<p>Detecting the LH variant, NUliner will provide support in indicating and predicting how far along the individual is along the cycle. the Midpoint of a cycle (approx. Day 14) is when LH variant reaches a rise called a LH Surge. The LH Surge is identified through a sudden rise of LH found in urine or other bodily discharges.</p>

	  		<p>By knowing the midpoint of her cycle, the individual can now approximate and count up the days since her last period (from first day of period) and add the halfway number again in order to get the end of the cycle (menstration) and the next cycle.</p>

	  <h2>Sarah's Story</h2>
	  <div class="overall">
	  	<div class="SectionThree">
	  		<p>Sarah is a 14-year-old student. She currently lives with her dad as her mom passed away when she was only 2. Living in a single-parent household with two brothers, it is difficult for Sarah to receive proper education about the female body when approaching the stage of puberty. It is her fourth month now, but she learns that she has an irregular cycle. Being a sensitive topic to confide in with her friends and family, she is embarrassed to talk about the change in her body.</p>

			<p>It is tedious and confusing for Sarah to calculate her cycle using calendar. Also, Sarah’s dad who works long hours, he is unable to be at home often and he is unable to teach Sarah about the female reproductive system. With NULiner, Sarah will now have access to a portable LH test that does not require her to consult a medical professional as NUliner have been proven to be accurate in predicting a women’s menstrual cycle.</p>

	  <h2>Margaret's Story</h2>
	  <div class="overall">
	  	<div class="SectionThree">
	  		<p>Margaret is a 28-year-old investment banker. Her job requires extensive hours due to many clients’ demands. Margaret often has to work overtime in order to fulfill her quota and is required to travel outside of Canada to meet clients. This lifestyle has lasted for over two years now and Margaret’s health is beginning to show its effects. Due to the stress of her job, her body’s hormone levels have began to fluctuate and her cycle has become an irregular pattern.</p>

	  		<p>Instead of using a calendar, Margaret wants to find a practical way to track her period. As a young working professional, NUliner will help individuals who do not lead a regulated and healthy lifestyle. For Margaret, because she is busy and often travelling out of town, the stress of having your period when travelling and working long hours adds up. By using NUliner, it will help Margaret predict at which phase she is in the menstrual cycle.</p>

			<p><span>My name is Eulina.</span> I am currently a college student and a beauty blogger. NU has recently reached out to me and gave me an opportunity to try out one of their new products, the NULiner for 30 days. So far, my experience with NULiner has been impeccable.</p>
			<br>
			<p><span>Reason One.</span> I am someone who forgets and doesn't think much about my monthly cycle and using a calendar is too tedious for me. With NUliner, it helps with this issue as I am quite forgetful and I always work around the clock so my cycle is not that regular.</p>
			<br>
			<p><span>Reason Two.</span> It is way more than just a comfortable and absorbent liner. By changing colours, the indicator embedded in NUliner accurately reflects the current stage of my cycle. I don’t need to worry what day my period will come and I will know when to carry pads/tampons with me. </p>
