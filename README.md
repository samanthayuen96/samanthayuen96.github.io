This website features a fictional female sanitary product called the NULiner 

NULiner is the result of the research demonstrate that this products need is not high in demand, however NUliner seeks to be an alternative feminine hygiene product that the individual can use to keep track of their cycle.

In order to take immediate measures to launch and promote NU’s NUliners alongside NU’s
existing product range:
• We want NU to adopt a fresh and loyal image to the female audience
• Launch a campaign which contains product endorsement statements by renowned
health experts
• In the future, we hope to expand NU in retail outlets at a national level and hopefully
internationally as a standard feminine hygiene product that medical professionals
recommend
• Furthermore, NU wants to create a cost-efficient packaging for users in that there are 3
available thickness levels of the product depending the situation the user is in

The different technical processes and steps that took place in making decisions about the final
product was done by the extensive research done at the laboratory at NU. 

Trusting our medical experts and engineers, we were able to come up with a product that provided support for the
accurate prediction of a women’s period with the ease of colour-coding. 

With no abrasive chemicals, users are ensured that all products are safe to use under the preconditions stated in
the rest of the proposal. 

Through this website, it will showcase the innovation behind the product and its unconventional usage of an LH test founded by NU.
